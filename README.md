Getting Started
Our collaborator team includes Nurlan_Sarkhanov, Udawala_Hewage_Dil, Joshua Batt, and Thanh Nguyen. Here below is our tasks and challenges that need to be achieved within a day:
- We think there are 3 different galaxies in our cluster of data find them and map them.
- Generate a map only of the uppermost galaxy
- we think BeBe Yoda is in the rightmost planet of this galaxy. Plot the highlighted planet on the original data
- Input the coordinates into the force finder
- From the planet data you will need to extract the force concentration and its two principal components. Map them.
- Find BeBe Yoda in the closest point to the gravitational center of the two principal components of the force. Highlight in a map the gravitational center and the closest point.
- Deliver the force coordinates to high command.
